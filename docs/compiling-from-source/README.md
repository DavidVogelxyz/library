Compiling programs from source code
===================================

[Back to "Docs and guides"](../README.md)

Introduction
------------

This set of documents and guides contain useful tips for compiling various programs from source code.

NOTE: some of these guides were written because one program required another to be built from source. Please refer **first** to the program of interest -- if another package is required, and a guide exists, it should be available as a link.
